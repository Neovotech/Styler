# Initial Questions

Ever found a jacket or sweater with a great fit that’s comfortable to wear? Alas, it’s plain black and boring. 

Wondering what it might look like otherwise, in a different variation - another colour, pattern, size, or worn on a different person entirely.

What about being a designer? You might be stumped and find it hard to come up with a creative new design or pattern.
